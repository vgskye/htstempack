# Hey! HTSTEM modded minecraft server! 

## Technical

### Graphics
Shaders will tank performance near Create setups, due to shaders being mutually exclusive with Create's rendering optimizations.
There exists [a mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iris-flywheel-compat) that tries to fix this, but it is untested and may result in crashes or rendering bugs.

## Gameplay
### Modded Basics
If you've played a modpack before, you can skip this one!

#### AppleSkin
Your hunger bar now shows saturation and exhaustion values, which is not visible in vanilla.
For more information about the mechanics, check [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Hunger#Mechanics).

#### Jade
Shows information about the block/entity you're looking at as a HUD.

#### EMI
